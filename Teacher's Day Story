**Ms Catherine Ng**
There was one time when someone came to observe our class during the Maths lesson to observe our learning atitude and our participation in class. 
A few days before that lesson, Ms Ng instructed us on what to do and how we should behave, prepared us on how we should pair ourselves on that day
She also reminded us to be more participative during that lesson and speak up more loudly.
When the teacher walked into our class that day, the whole class was especially silent while standing up at our seats, preparing to greet the teacher.

That was the first lesson where everyone could answer all the questions Ms Ng directed towards us without hesitation.
Ms Ng made sure to let everyone have a chance to answer the questions and to be participative.
Everyone sat upright in their seats, no one daring to slouch or even talk unless instructed to.
When instructed to start the pair activity, everyone immediately joined their tables with their partners
During the pair activity, no one was screaming or laughing loudly like we usually did.
Instead, everyone was quietly discussing with their partners on how to complete the worksheet
The teacher that was observing us walked around the classroom silently and everyone could feel the tension in the air.
When the lesson finally ended and the teacher left the classroom, everyone finally relaxed in their seats and let out a breath of relief
This was one event when the whole class and Ms Ng worked together to give off our greatest impressions!:)
